# Embedded System Design Project

## Overview 
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an embedded system project developed as part of a master's degree program. The project focuses on designing applications for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, specifically targeting the Nucleo F756ZG development board.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to apply the principles and techniques learned in the master's degree program to design and implement embedded system applications. The project emphasizes hands-on experience with ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, and it serves as a practical application of theoretical concepts covered in the program.

## Project Features
- **Microcontroller:** ARM Cortex-M on Nucleo F756ZG development board.
- **Application Focus:** [Briefly describe the main functionality or purpose of your embedded system application.]

## Skills Developed
The following skills are required and trained during the course of this project:
- **Embedded Systems:** Gain practical experience in designing and implementing embedded systems.
- **ARM Cortex-M Architecture:** Understand the architecture and programming model of ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.
- **Peripheral Interface:** Interface with peripherals such as GPIO, UART, I2C, and SPI.
- **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):** Implement and utilize an RTOS for task scheduling and synchronization.
- **Low-Level Programming:** Write low-level firmware code for efficient and optimized performance.
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Learn techniques for debugging and optimizing embedded systems code.
- **Version Control:** Use Git for version control and collaboration.
